I want you to program a nice resume website. 

When entering the site you should be greeted by an almost full sized background video with some text and profile picture as overlay. 

Scrolling down will show a section with a text about me and a photo of me which is animated. 

Scrolling further shows an animated grid of thumbnails for projects I have done. The projects can be filtered. 

Finally there is a animated timeline showing my education and work experience. 

I use the following tools:
- Yarn
- Webpack
- React
- Vscode
- Babel

I have so far split up the code into these sections and have a simple site working:
- App.js
- Start.js
- AboutMe.js
- Projects.js
- Timeline.js
- Menu.js

This is my color palette:
#FE938C
#E6B89C
#EAD2AC
#9CAFB7
#4281A4

You can use dummy data for the text and images.

Can you help with writing the code for the timeline section?

I have this so far:
```javascript
// src/Timeline.js
import React from 'react';
import './Timeline.css';

const Timeline = () => {
    return (
        <section className="timeline" id="timeline">
            <h2>Education and Work Experience</h2>
            {/* Add your timeline here */}
        </section>
    );
};

export default Timeline;
```

```css
/* src/Timeline.css */
.timeline {
    padding: 2rem;
}
```

Can you make the timeline so that it builds as one scrolls down the page? With items switching left to right every other item. Also use the color scheme when styling. For each item include an image. Populate it with the following:
